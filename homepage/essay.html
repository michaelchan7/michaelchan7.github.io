            <p></p>
            <p>A Japanese bookstore hidden inside the city, also known as Books Kinokuniya, or as I like to call it the manga store is one of my memorable places. This is a part of my New York because I enjoy reading manga and watching anime, and this is one the best manga stores I’ve been to. Even though I’ve only been there 4 times, it’s a memorable place for me since I've been there with people that I'm close to who also share the same interest as me. </p>
            <p>Kinokuniya offers a wide variety of items to satisfy their customers. Something to expect is their wide selection of Japanese books. They include books that teach you how to write and speak Japanese, while also having books that teach you English and Chinese. If you’ve ever wanted to learn about Japan's history, they have it. They got books from learning new languages all the way to learning how to cook. If you’re interested in anime and manga, you’re in luck. Kinokuniya has a whole section just for that, having many popular mangas such as Attack on Titan, Jujutsu Kaisen, and much more. Their books can get a bit pricey, but if you’re willing to spend the money it will be worth it. The store also offers accessories and figurines from famous animations such as, Spirited Away, Ponyo on the Cliff, Kiki’s Delivery Service, My Neighbor Totoro, and much more. If you’re ever feeling hungry you can stop by and grab an onigiri or get some coffee.

            <p>As a person who likes anime, this store was very impressive to me. I first heard about this store through my sister. She told me about how she just discovered an anime store in the city and that we should go since one of our favorite anime had a pop up there. I remember going there feeling very excited as I recognized some of the songs playing on the speaker from my favorite anime. As we went in to take a look, we were both shocked to see how much stuff they had and how pricey the items were. The figurines cost up to $300 dollars each and we were surprised to see people actually buying them. The next time I came back it was with my friends. I had such a great experience that I had to tell them about it since they also liked anime. We went and bought some mangas, which we thought were very pricey but we were satisfied with our purchase. Through this experience I was able to create more memories as I tell myself “create memories that you will never forget and cherish them, cause you won’t get a second chance.”</p>
            <p>When others come to this store, some won’t understand why we like it. This store can fill your desires and joy. Those who like anime and manga would agree with me that being able to have your favorite character or manga will fill you with joy. Others might see this as a regular Japanese book store, but it’s not. I’ve been to other manga stores and it doesn’t compare to Kinokuniya because it has a wider selection of books to choose from compared to a regular store. Not only does Kinokuniya have a wide selection of books but it also has a bunch of collectibles for fans. People who don’t understand the point of having figures and say that it’s a waste of money and serves no purpose don’t know how we feel. We buy them because they have our memories of the character in them and we remember scenes of them. They can also add some style to your rooms.</p>
            <p>My memories of Kinokuniya will always be here until I’m gone. Others might not care about any of this, but they all have their own memories and interests that will be with them until they're gone. </p>
